# Comments and observations about Sourav's code

In this file are some observations about Sourav's code 

## List of hyperparameters

normalize : transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])

transform : transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize((224, 224)), transforms.ToTensor(), normalize])

dataloader : batch_size = 32

criterion (=loss function) : nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

optimizer : optim.Adam

number of epochs : 60

## Other comments

Criterion : CrossEntropyLoss (isn't BCEwithLogitLoss supposed to be better for binary classification?)
