# Explainable-AI-malware-detection

Malware detection with added explanability through saliency map on Android APK using PyTorch and Androguard.

## Requirements

To run the code you need to create a conda environment. You can do so by running the following commands after cloning the repository:

```bash
    conda create --name malware_detection_research --file conda-package-list.txt
    conda activate malware_detection_research
```

> üóíÔ∏è Note: we used Androguard 3.3.5 and not the version 4.0.2 because of a bug in the submodules not being recognized by PyLance.

## Acknowledgement

This project is based on the following paper:

[1] [Obfuscation detection for Android applications](https://github.com/alevit33/apk_obfuscation_detector/tree/master#obfuscation-detection-for-android-applications) : We used `create_image.py` and `map-saturation.png` to transform the APKs into images while developing our own method.

[2] [Fast adversarial training using FGSM](https://github.com/Raideeen/fast_adversarial) Based on paper [Fast is better than free: Revisiting adversarial training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03994) by Athalye et al. We used `fast_adversarial.py` to train our model.
